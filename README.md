## 🌟 Projects

### 🚦 Border Crossing Analysis

The **Border Crossing Analysis** project aims to provide insights into patterns of border crossings over time by analyzing datasets related to border activities. The analysis includes steps for data cleaning, transformation, visualization, and statistical modeling to uncover trends and significant factors influencing these patterns.

- **Directory:** [Border_Crossing](https://github.com/dustinober1/r_portfolio/tree/main/Border_Crossing)
- **Contents:**
  - `data/`: Datasets utilized in the analysis.
  - `scripts/`: R scripts for data preprocessing, visualization, and statistical modeling.
  - `plots/`: Generated plots and visualizations illustrating the findings.
- **Features:**
  - Data cleaning and transformation techniques.
  - Time series analysis and trend identification.
  - Visual representation of patterns and anomalies.

### 🧩 Community Detection

The **Community Detection** project explores various algorithms and methodologies to detect communities within complex networks. This project dives into methods like hierarchical clustering, modularity optimization, and network analysis to reveal meaningful patterns and relationships within the data.

- **Directory:** [Community Detection](https://github.com/dustinober1/r_portfolio/tree/main/Community%20Detection)
- **Contents:**
  - `data/`: Raw input data files for community detection analysis.
  - `scripts/`: R scripts implementing multiple community detection algorithms.
  - `results/`: Visual and textual output showcasing the results of the analysis.
- **Features:**
  - Implementation of different community detection algorithms.
  - Network visualization and community structure analysis.
  - Comparative analysis of methods and outcomes.
