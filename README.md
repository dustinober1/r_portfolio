## Projects

### Border Crossing Analysis

The **Border Crossing Analysis** project focuses on analyzing border crossing data. This project includes scripts for data cleaning, processing, visualization, and statistical analysis to understand patterns in border crossings over time.

- **Directory:** [Border_Crossing](https://github.com/dustinober1/r_portfolio/tree/main/Border_Crossing)
- **Contents:**
  - `data/`: Contains the datasets used in the analysis.
  - `scripts/`: R scripts for data preprocessing, visualization, and analysis.
  - `plots/`: Generated plots and visualizations.

### Community Detection

The **Community Detection** project involves applying various algorithms to detect communities within datasets. This project explores methods such as hierarchical clustering, modularity optimization, and network-based approaches to identify meaningful groupings.

- **Directory:** [Community Detection](https://github.com/dustinober1/r_portfolio/tree/main/Community%20Detection)
- **Contents:**
  - `data/`: Input data files for community detection.
  - `scripts/`: R scripts for implementing community detection algorithms.
  - `results/`: Output results and visualizations.
